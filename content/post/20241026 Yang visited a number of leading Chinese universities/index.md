"In October 2024, Yang had the opportunity to visit several leading universities in China, including Chongqing University, Xihua University, Sichuan University, Central South University, and Hunan University. During these visits, he toured their labs and explored the latest research developments in civil and construction engineering. He also shared information about the University of Auckland, life and work in New Zealand, and the infrastructure automation and intelligence research he is leading at Auckland.

We look forward to strengthening our international collaboration with these esteemed universities and colleagues in China and warmly welcome more talented individuals from China to join our group in the future.
