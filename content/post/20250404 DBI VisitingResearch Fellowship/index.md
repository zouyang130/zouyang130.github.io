We are pleased to share that Dr Yang Zou and our second-year PhD candidate, Zhen Zhang, have been awarded the Visiting Research Fellowship by Australia’s Decarbonising the Building Industry (DBI) Network. This AU$8,000 fellowship, administered by the University of Melbourne, will support Zhen and Yang for a two-week visit to the University of Melbourne later this year.

This achievement was made possible with the support of Dr. M. Reza Hosseini and Professor Sarah Bell from the University of Melbourne. We also sincerely appreciate the DBI Network team’s consideration and support.

The purpose of this fellowship is to disseminate key findings from an ongoing project focused on knowledge reuse and sharing in the context of decarbonisation. Additionally, we plan to test and evaluate our knowledge management system with building industry stakeholders in Australia. Through meetings, workshops, and seminars, we aim to bring valuable insights and experiences back to New Zealand.

This academic visit also aims to establish a strategic partnership between the University of Auckland and the DBI team, fostering stronger collaboration between New Zealand and Australia in advancing sustainable construction practices.
