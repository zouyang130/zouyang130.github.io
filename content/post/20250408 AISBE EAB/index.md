Dr Yang Zou has been invited to join the Editoral Advisory Board (EAB) of a brand new, fully open access journal entitled Artificial Intelligence for a Sustainable Built Environment (AISBE). AISBE is a cutting edge, inter-/trans- disciplinary gold open access journal that aims to advance knowledge in AI applications within architecture, civil and construction engineering. The journal seeks to publish high-quality, peer-reviewed research that explores the intersection of AI, sustainability, and resilience in the built environment. By fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation, the journal will contribute to the development of smarter, more sustainable infrastructure and construction practices. While AI is a focal point for the journal, it will also showcase the whole spectrum of construction and civil engineering research in digital and computer technologies. The journal also aligns with and supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN-SDGs), particularly SDG9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, SDG11 Sustainable Cities and Communities, SDG13 Climate Action, and SDG7 Affordable and Clean Energy.
