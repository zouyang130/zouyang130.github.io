I am delighted to share that our PhD gradaute Xiaofei Yang just had his paper titled 'Automated Concrete Bridge Damage Detection Using an Efficient Vision Transformer-Enhanced Anchor-Free YOLO’ accepted by Engineering (Elsevier) after an extensive one-and-a-half-year review process. Engineering is the official journal of Chinese Academy of Engineering and its latest Impact Factor is 10.1. This is the last piece of work generated from Xiaofei’s PhD – all his PhD work has been published in the top journals in construction informatics!

Well done Xiaofei!

Xiaofei was a PhD student at University of Auckland supervised by Enrique del Rey Castillo, Yang Zou and Liam Wotherspoon. He is now a Postdoctoral Fellow at Nanyang Technological University Singapore.
