It is pleased to share that our PhD graduates, Cheng Zhang and Feng Wang, have had their technical article titled “Automated UAV Image-to-BIM Registration for Planar and Curved Building Façades Using Structure-from-Motion and 3D Surface Unwrapping ” accepted for publication in the Elsevier journal of Automation in Construction.

The work is part of Cheng’s PhD thesis and was supported by Feng. The peer review process has been more than 14 months! But finally we managed to get it accepted. Well done, Cheng and Feng!
