Tianlong Zhang is a PhD student from Southwest Jiaotong University, focusing on railway alignment optimization using AI. He joined Yang's group as a visiting PhD scholar funded by China Scholarshiop Council (CSC) in October 2023 for a one-year stay. At our September 2024 group meeting, Tianlong presented his pioneering research and shared his insights on applying AI to engineering design. During his time in Auckland, he published a technical article in Automation in Construction and has another paper under review in a Q1 journal. We greatly appreciated Tianlongâ€™s visit and extend our best wishes for his future career!
