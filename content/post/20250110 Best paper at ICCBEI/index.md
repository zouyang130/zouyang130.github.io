I am delighted to share that we won the Best Paper Award at the recent 6th International Conference on Civil and Building Engineering Informatics (ICCBEI 2025) for our paper, “Enhancing Knowledge Capture and Reuse for Offsite Construction Through a Container-Based Knowledge Approach”. This paper introduces a novel container-based knowledge system (CBKS) framework for offsite construction (OSC), integrating the semantic web stack and AI technologies, including GPT-4o, to enhance knowledge capture, reuse, and collaboration.

This paper was led by our gruop member Zhen Zhang and was generated from the BRANZ funded research project “Improving Performance and Collaboration for Offsite Construction through Learning between Projects and Knowledge Reuse”.

The conference, hosted by the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) from 8–11 January 2025, is the official conference of the Asian Group for Civil Engineering Informatics (AGCEI), a sister organisation of the International Society for Computing in Civil and Building Engineering (ISCCBE). This year, ICCBEI received over 140 paper submissions, of which 110 were accepted, and 5 were selected for Best Paper Awards.
