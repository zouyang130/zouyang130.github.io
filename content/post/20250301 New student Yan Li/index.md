We are delighted to share that we have a new group member, Yan LI (李妍). 

Yan, originally from China, finished my bachelor’s and master’s degree at Dalian University of Technology and Harbin Institute of Technology, respectively. She is now decided to PhD research in our group. Her research will be mainly about the development of robotics for the maintenance of civil structures. She looks forward to starting the whole new journey in New Zealand.

Yan formally starts her 4-year PhD programme on 1 March 2025 in our group with the financial support of University of Auckland and China Scholarship Council. She will investigate the design, build and evaluate next-generation infrastructure robotics.
