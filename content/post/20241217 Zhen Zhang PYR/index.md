I am delighted to share that our PhD student, Zhen Zhang, has successfully passed his provisional year review! He is now confirmed to proceed to the next stage of his PhD research. He is investigating how to facilitate knowledge capture and reuse for offsite construction projects through semantic web and AI. 

Zhen is co-supervised by A/P Lixin Zhang (UoA Department of Psychology), and advised by Dr Brian Guo, Dr Roy Davies (UoA) and Dr Johannes Dimyadi (CAS Ltd).

This PhD project is funded by BRANZ.
