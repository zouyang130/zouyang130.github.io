On 24 October 2024, we were delighted to welcome Professor Shang-Hsien (Patrick) Hsieh (謝尚賢) from National Taiwan University (NTU) to our Smart Digital Lab at the University of Auckland. His seminar, Digital Transformation for a Sustainable Smart Built Environment, was both insightful and engaging. We look forward to fostering a closer connection with Professor Hsieh and NTU.

The seminar was jointly hosted by the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering and the Future Cities Research Centre (FCRC). Special thanks to Associate Professor Paola Boarin and Dr. Mohsen Mohammadzadeh for their tremendous support in making this event possible! We were thrilled to have over 30 participants join us in person and more than 270 register for the online seminar. Thank you all for your interest and support!
