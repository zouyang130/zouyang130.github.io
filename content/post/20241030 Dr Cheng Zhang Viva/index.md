We are thrilled to share the good news that Cheng Zhang has successfully passed his oral examination and received his PhD title today on 30 October 2024! His thesis, titled "Building Information Modelling-based Smart Inspection Data Management for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle-enabled Visual Building Inspection" represents a significant achievement and a valuable contribution to the field of construction automation.
 
Cheng began his PhD in 2021 but faced a unique challenge, as he was unable to leave China for almost 1.5 years due to COVID restrictions. Since arriving in Auckland in March 2022, he has worked diligently and completed his PhD in an impressive 2.5 years. His hard work and dedication are truly inspiring, and I look forward to his future contributions to our research community.
 
Congratulations once again, Dr Zhang!
