## About Me

I am a Senior Lecturer in Digital Construction at the [University of Auckland](www.auckland.ac.nz). I am the Programme Leader for postgraduate studies in Construction Management, as well as the Director of the [Smart Digital Lab (SDL)](https://my.matterport.com/show/?m=BJL6tB5cZrv). My research lies in the inter-disciplinary area of intelligent infrastructure and digital construction. I have focused on applying Building Information Modelling (BIM), Unmanned Aerial System (UAS), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Extended Reality (VR/AR/MR), Smart Sensing and Visualisation, throughout the lifecycle of complex building and large-scale infrastructure systems. My ultimate research goal is to develop a smarter, safer and better built environment to meet the new needs of a changing world.
